# GraphQL server in Go - Hello World
If you are new to GraphQL in Go, this repository should get you started quickly. The script `Server.go` starts a http server that accepts GraphQL queries at the endpoint `/graphql`. 

I use [graphql-go/graphql](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql), one of the few implementations of GraphQL in Go, just because there is more documentation available. Another implementation I found is [neelance/graphql-go](https://github.com/neelance/graphql-go).

## Getting started
First, start the server and then send a couple of requests with GraphQL queries. I dockerized the server to make it as easy as possible to get started.

    go get github.com/stefanhengl/graphql-goalang-hw
    docker build -t graphql-server .
    docker run -p 9090:9090 graphql-server

    üåç Listening on http://localhost:9090

Of course, you can also run the server outside docker. Make sure you have all dependencies installed though.

    go run server.go
    
    üåç Listening on http://localhost:9090

## Sending requests
When receiving an HTTP GET request, the GraphQL query should be specified in the "query" query string ([source](http://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#get-request)).
    
    GET /graphql?query={hello}

    {
        "data": {
            "hello": "world"
        }
    }

    GET /graphql?query={user{first,last}}

    {
        "data": {
            "user": {
                "first": "john",
                "last": "doe"
            }
        }
    }

    GET /graphql?query=mutation {changeUser(first: "foo", last: "bar")}

    {
        "data": {
            "changeUser": true
        }
    }

    GET /graphql?query={user{first,last}}

    {
        "data": {
            "user": {
                "first": "foo",
                "last": "bar"
            }
        }
    }

## Postman
The Postman collection `graphql-golang.hw.postlam_collection` contains templates for all the requests above ([doc](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats)).
